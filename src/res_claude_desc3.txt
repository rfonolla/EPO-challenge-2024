  "summary": "The claim describes a device for estimating the thickness of rigid material covering the pulp in a tooth. It comprises a light source arrangement that emits light at two wavelengths, a sensor arrangement that measures reflected light intensity at those wavelengths, and a processor that analyzes intensity maps from the sensor to estimate the thickness of the rigid material.",
